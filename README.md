An android library to help developers to implement voice commands in an easy way!

Alfred is always available for you and your application, but be polite! Example of pre-alpha api:

- Alfred.buildMyActionFromResources()
or
- Alfred.rememberThisAction()
- Alfred.pleaseDoNow(String receivedTextCommand) //Synchronous
- Alfred.pleaseDo(String receivedTextCommand)    // Asynchronous ;)
